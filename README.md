Some of these operations are:

1.`git int` : creates empty repository in current directory.

2.`git add .` : adds all files in directory to staging area of repository.

3.`git status` : shows status of all files : commited, not commited, in staging area etc.

4.`git commit` : commits all files in staging area.

5.`git commit -m`: commits and adds message to the commit.

6.`git checkout` : helps switch from one branch to another.

7.`git branch` : shows all branches in repository, current branch is marked with `*`.

8.`git merge` : merges two branches in fast forward manner.

9.`git merge --no-ff` : merges two branches in no fast forward mannner.

10.`git rebase` : changes the base of your branch from one commit to another.
